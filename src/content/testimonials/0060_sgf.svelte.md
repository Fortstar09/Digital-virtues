SGF International is a powerful association of industrial self-control of the fruit and vegetable juice industry from the tree to the bottle. We carry out audits and plant inspections, draw samples and analyse them physico-chemically. 
<!-- Samples from audited production are of particular importance here - their results show the region-specific characteristics of fruit and vegetable juices. -->

<!-- Peter and Sascha played an instrumental role in developing a Python-based solution to process raw material and regional analytical data. Their contributions in conceptual refinement, programming, and customisation have significantly strengthened our products and services.
Besides their engagement in this specific project Peter has supported our General Manager strategically for many years as well as in several other projects i.e. the multi year project to create an audit app including a general audit management web interface. -->
